                <h2>Mid-Autumn Festival</h2>
                <p>The story of Hou Yi and Chang’e plays a central role in the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the most important traditional festivals in China. Celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar, the festival is marked by the full moon, symbolizing reunion and harmony. During the festival, people gather with family and friends to admire the full moon, light lanterns, and enjoy mooncakes, a special pastry often filled with sweet or savory ingredients. The tradition of offering mooncakes to Chang’e originates from the story where Hou Yi, after Chang’e ascended to the moon, would leave her favorite desserts as a sign of forgiveness. This act of honoring Chang’e continues today, as offerings are made to the moon goddess during the festival.</p>
